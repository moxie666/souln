           <p>Since the age of 8 I had horrendous acne. At 13 I took Accutane and all that went away but I was left with scars and some hyper pigmentation. People were so mean, boys used to call me ugly and make fun of me. I just felt ugly all the time. I couldn't handle the pressure and so I left school.
            </p>

                <p>During the years I was out of school I put on a lot of weight and managed to get diabetes. I got acne again, but it wasn't as bad as the first time, I just have a lot of hyper pigmentation. It's now been 2 months since I've been diligently working out and eating right and I don't get acne any more, but the hyper pigmentation is very persistent. I've been applying doctor prescribed hydroquinone on the affected areas twice daily since the beginning of this month, but I'm not seeing much of a difference. Yesterday, I noticed a lot of visible bumps (they're smooth to the touch but visible in very bright areas, I'm not sure what they're called) so I didn't use the hydroquinone yesterday.</p>

               <p>I just want perfect skin so badly. I know I'll probably never get rid of the scars but I want the hyper pigmentation on my face to disappear so badly.</p>

            <h1>How to Manifest your Dreams to Reality
                </h1>
<p>     1. Keep the END in mind. Ask yourself, what specific quality of life will the object of my desire bring to me? Why do I want this? Will it bring more Love, Harmony, Joy, Peace, Wisdom or Prosperity?
</p>

<p>Once you identify your real goal, do your best to assimilate that quality without the object and you will be deliberating achieving a vibrational harmony with the object you desired in the first place. When you acquire vibrational harmony or magnetic sameness with your desire, the object of your desire or something better HAS to come into your life, for it is the Law!
</p>

<p>2. IDENTIFY what you want. The number one rule to Manifesting your Dreams is to “keep your eye on the ball.” The Universe does not process negatives – only energy. Therefore the question to ponder is what do you want? The question is NOT “what do I not want” except to identify more of what you DO want.
</p>

<p>3. EXPECT your dreams to come true. Expectation propels your desire and opens the runway for your dreams to land quickly, easily and gently. Additionally, with expectation as your fire”!

            <h1>Body Positivity</h1>

            <p>Body positivity refers to the assertion that all people deserve to have a positive body image, regardless of how society and popular culture view ideal shape, size, and appearance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the goals of the body positivity movement include:


                <ul>
                    <li>challenging how society views the body
                    </li>
                    <li>promoting the acceptance of all bodies
                    </li>
                    <li>helping people build confidence and acceptance of their own bodies
                    </li>
                    <li>addressing unrealistic body standards
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Body positivity is not just about challenging how society views people based upon their physical size and shape, however. It also recognizes that judgments are often made based on race, gender, sexuality, and disability. 

            </p>

            <p>Body positivity also aims to help people understand how popular media messages contribute to the relationship that people have with their bodies, including how they feel about food, exercise, clothing, health, identity, and self-care. By better understanding the effect that such influences have, the hope is that people can develop a healthier and more realistic relationship with their bodies.
